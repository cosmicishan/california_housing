 Neural network model for regression on the California housing dataset using TensorFlow

The notebook implements a neural network model for regression on the California housing dataset. It uses the TensorFlow framework and various libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The model has six layers, with the first five having ReLU activation and the final layer having one neuron without any activation function. The loss function is set to "mse," and the optimizer is set to "sgd." Callbacks like ModelCheckpoint, EarlyStopping, and TensorBoard are used to save the best model weights, stop the training process early, and create a log of the training progress, respectively. The model is trained using the fit() method, and the training process is visualized using TensorBoard.
